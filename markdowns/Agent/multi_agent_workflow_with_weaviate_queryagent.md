In this example, we will be building a LlamaIndex Agent Workflow that ends up being a multi-agent system that aims to be a Docs Assistant capable of:
- Writing new content to a "LlamaIndexDocs" collection in Weaviate
- Writing new content to a "WeaviateDocs" collection in Weaviate
- Using the Weaviate [`QueryAgent`](https://weaviate.io/developers/agents/query) to answer questions based on the contents of these collections.

The `QueryAgent` is a full agent prodcut by Weaviate, that is capable of doing regular search, as well as aggregations over the collections you give it access to. Our 'orchestrator' agent will decide when to invoke the Weaviate QueryAgent, leaving the job of creating Weaviate specific search queries to it.

**Things you will need:**

- An OpenAI API key (or switch to another provider and adjust the code below)
- A Weaviate sandbox (this is free)
- Your Weaviate sandbox URL and API key

## Install & Import Dependencies


```python
!pip install llama-index-core llama-index-utils-workflow weaviate-client[agents] llama-index-llms-openai llama-index-readers-web
```


```python
from llama_index.core.workflow import (
    StartEvent,
    StopEvent,
    Workflow,
    step,
    Event,
    Context,
)
from llama_index.utils.workflow import draw_all_possible_flows
from llama_index.readers.web import SimpleWebPageReader
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import FunctionAgent

from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from typing import List, Union
import json

import weaviate
from weaviate.auth import Auth
from weaviate.agents.query import QueryAgent
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure, Property, DataType

import os
from getpass import getpass
```

## Set up Weaviate

To use the Weaviate Query Agent, first, create a [Weaviate Cloud](https://weaviate.io/deployment/serverless) accountðŸ‘‡
1. [Create Serverless Weaviate Cloud account](https://weaviate.io/deployment/serverless) and set up a free [Sandbox](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/manage-clusters/create#sandbox-clusters)
2. Go to 'Embedding' and enable it, by default, this will make it so that we use `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0` as the embedding model
3. Take note of the `WEAVIATE_URL` and `WEAVIATE_API_KEY` to connect to your cluster below

> Info: We recommend using [Weaviate Embeddings](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/model-providers/weaviate) so you do not have to provide any extra keys for external embedding providers.


```python
if "WEAVIATE_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["WEAVIATE_API_KEY"] = getpass("Add Weaviate API Key")
if "WEAVIATE_URL" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["WEAVIATE_URL"] = getpass("Add Weaviate URL")
```


```python
client = weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud(
    cluster_url=os.environ.get("WEAVIATE_URL"),
    auth_credentials=Auth.api_key(os.environ.get("WEAVIATE_API_KEY")),
)
```

### Create WeaviateDocs and LlamaIndexDocs Collections

The helper function below will create a "WeaviateDocs" and "LlamaIndexDocs" collection in Weaviate (if they don't exist already). It will also set up a `QueryAgent` that has access to both of these collections.

The Weaviate [`QueryAgent`](https://weaviate.io/blog/query-agent) is designed to be able to query Weviate Collections for both regular search and aggregations, and also handles the burden of creating the Weaviate specific queries internally.

The Agent will use the collection descriptions, as well as the property descriptions while formilating the queries.


```python
def fresh_setup_weaviate(client):
    if client.collections.exists("WeaviateDocs"):
        client.collections.delete("WeaviateDocs")
    client.collections.create(
        "WeaviateDocs",
        description="A dataset with the contents of Weaviate technical Docs and website",
        vectorizer_config=Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_weaviate(),
        properties=[
            Property(
                name="url",
                data_type=DataType.TEXT,
                description="the source URL of the webpage",
            ),
            Property(
                name="text",
                data_type=DataType.TEXT,
                description="the content of the webpage",
            ),
        ],
    )

    if client.collections.exists("LlamaIndexDocs"):
        client.collections.delete("LlamaIndexDocs")
    client.collections.create(
        "LlamaIndexDocs",
        description="A dataset with the contents of LlamaIndex technical Docs and website",
        vectorizer_config=Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_weaviate(),
        properties=[
            Property(
                name="url",
                data_type=DataType.TEXT,
                description="the source URL of the webpage",
            ),
            Property(
                name="text",
                data_type=DataType.TEXT,
                description="the content of the webpage",
            ),
        ],
    )

    agent = QueryAgent(
        client=client, collections=["LlamaIndexDocs", "WeaviateDocs"]
    )
    return agent
```

### Write Contents of Webpage to the Collections

The helper function below uses the `SimpleWebPageReader` to write the contents of a webpage to the relevant Weaviate collection


```python
def write_webpages_to_weaviate(client, urls: list[str], collection_name: str):
    documents = SimpleWebPageReader(html_to_text=True).load_data(urls)
    collection = client.collections.get(collection_name)
    with collection.batch.dynamic() as batch:
        for doc in documents:
            batch.add_object(properties={"url": doc.id_, "text": doc.text})
```

## Create a Function Calling Agent

Now that we have the relevant functions to write to a collection and also the `QueryAgent` at hand, we can start by using the `FunctionAgent`, which is a simple tool calling agent.


```python
if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass("openai-key")
```


```python
weaviate_agent = fresh_setup_weaviate(client)
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")


def write_to_weaviate_collection(urls=list[str]):
    """Useful for writing new content to the WeaviateDocs collection"""
    write_webpages_to_weaviate(client, urls, "WeaviateDocs")


def write_to_li_collection(urls=list[str]):
    """Useful for writing new content to the LlamaIndexDocs collection"""
    write_webpages_to_weaviate(client, urls, "LlamaIndexDocs")


def query_agent(query: str) -> str:
    """Useful for asking questions about Weaviate and LlamaIndex"""
    response = weaviate_agent.run(query)
    return response.final_answer


agent = FunctionAgent(
    tools=[write_to_weaviate_collection, write_to_li_collection, query_agent],
    llm=llm,
    system_prompt="""You are a helpful assistant that can write the
      contents of urls to WeaviateDocs and LlamaIndexDocs collections,
      as well as forwarding questions to a QueryAgent""",
)
```


```python
response = await agent.run(
    user_msg="Can you save https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/agent_workflow_basic/"
)
print(str(response))
```


```python
response = await agent.run(
    user_msg="""What are llama index workflows? And can you save
    these to weaviate docs: https://weaviate.io/blog/what-are-agentic-workflows
    and https://weaviate.io/blog/ai-agents"""
)
print(str(response))
```

    Llama Index workflows refer to orchestrations involving one or more AI agents within the LlamaIndex framework. These workflows manage complex tasks dynamically by leveraging components such as large language models (LLMs), tools, and memory states. Key features of Llama Index workflows include:
    
    - Support for single or multiple agents managed within an AgentWorkflow orchestrator.
    - Ability to maintain state across runs via serializable context objects.
    - Integration of external tools with type annotations, including asynchronous functions.
    - Streaming of intermediate outputs and event-based interactions.
    - Human-in-the-loop capabilities to confirm or guide agent actions during workflow execution.
    
    These workflows enable agents to execute sequences of operations, call external tools asynchronously, maintain conversation or task states, stream partial results, and incorporate human inputs when necessary. They embody dynamic, agent-driven sequences of task decomposition, tool use, and reflection, allowing AI systems to plan, act, and improve iteratively toward specific goals.
    
    I have also saved the contents from the provided URLs to the WeaviateDocs collection.



```python
response = await agent.run(
    user_msg="How many docs do I have in the weaviate and llamaindex collections in total?"
)
print(str(response))
```

    You have a total of 2 documents in the WeaviateDocs collection and 1 document in the LlamaIndexDocs collection. In total, that makes 3 documents across both collections.



```python
weaviate_agent = fresh_setup_weaviate(client)
```

## Create a Workflow with Branches

### Simple Example: Create Events

A LlamaIndex Workflow has 2 fundamentals:
- An Event
- A Step

An step may return an event, and an event may trigger a step!

For our use-case, we can imagine thet there are 4 events:


```python
class EvaluateQuery(Event):
    query: str


class WriteLlamaIndexDocsEvent(Event):
    urls: list[str]


class WriteWeaviateDocsEvent(Event):
    urls: list[str]


class QueryAgentEvent(Event):
    query: str
```

### Simple Example: A Branching Workflow (that does nothing yet)


```python
class DocsAssistantWorkflow(Workflow):
    @step
    async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> EvaluateQuery:
        return EvaluateQuery(query=ev.query)

    @step
    async def evaluate_query(
        self, ctx: Context, ev: EvaluateQuery
    ) -> QueryAgentEvent | WriteLlamaIndexDocsEvent | WriteWeaviateDocsEvent | StopEvent:
        if ev.query == "llama":
            return WriteLlamaIndexDocsEvent(urls=[ev.query])
        if ev.query == "weaviate":
            return WriteWeaviateDocsEvent(urls=[ev.query])
        if ev.query == "question":
            return QueryAgentEvent(query=ev.query)
        return StopEvent()

    @step
    async def write_li_docs(
        self, ctx: Context, ev: WriteLlamaIndexDocsEvent
    ) -> StopEvent:
        print(f"Got a request to write something to LlamaIndexDocs")
        return StopEvent()

    @step
    async def write_weaviate_docs(
        self, ctx: Context, ev: WriteWeaviateDocsEvent
    ) -> StopEvent:
        print(f"Got a request to write something to WeaviateDocs")
        return StopEvent()

    @step
    async def query_agent(
        self, ctx: Context, ev: QueryAgentEvent
    ) -> StopEvent:
        print(f"Got a request to forward a query to the QueryAgent")
        return StopEvent()
```


```python
workflow_that_does_nothing = DocsAssistantWorkflow()

# draw_all_possible_flows(workflow_that_does_nothing)
```


```python
print(
    await workflow_that_does_nothing.run(start_event=StartEvent(query="llama"))
)
```

    Got a request to write something to LlamaIndexDocs
    None


### Classify the Query with Structured Outputs


```python
class SaveToLlamaIndexDocs(BaseModel):
    """The URLs to parse and save into a llama-index specific docs collection."""

    llama_index_urls: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)


class SaveToWeaviateDocs(BaseModel):
    """The URLs to parse and save into a weaviate specific docs collection."""

    weaviate_urls: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)


class Ask(BaseModel):
    """The natural language questions that can be asked to a Q&A agent."""

    queries: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)


class Actions(BaseModel):
    """Actions to take based on the latest user message."""

    actions: List[
        Union[SaveToLlamaIndexDocs, SaveToWeaviateDocs, Ask]
    ] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

#### Create a Workflow

Let's create a workflow that, still, does nothing, but the incoming user query will be converted to our structure. Based on the contents of that structure, the workflow will decide which step to run.

Notice how whichever step runs first, will return a `StopEvent`... This is good, but maybe we can improve that later!


```python
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAIResponses


class DocsAssistantWorkflow(Workflow):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.llm = OpenAIResponses(model="gpt-4.1-mini")
        self.system_prompt = """You are a docs assistant. You evaluate incoming queries and break them down to subqueries when needed.
                          You decide on the next best course of action. Overall, here are the options:
                          - You can write the contents of a URL to llamaindex docs (if it's a llamaindex url)
                          - You can write the contents of a URL to weaviate docs (if it's a weaviate url)
                          - You can answer a question about llamaindex and weaviate using the QueryAgent"""
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    @step
    async def start(self, ev: StartEvent) -> EvaluateQuery:
        return EvaluateQuery(query=ev.query)

    @step

        self, ev: EvaluateQuery
    ) -> QueryAgentEvent | WriteLlamaIndexDocsEvent | WriteWeaviateDocsEvent:

                ChatMessage(role="user", content=ev.query),
            ]
        )
        actions = response.raw.actions
        print(actions)
        for action in actions:

            elif isinstance(action, Ask):

    @step
    async def write_li_docs(self, ev: WriteLlamaIndexDocsEvent) -> StopEvent:
        print(f"Writing {ev.urls} to LlamaIndex Docs")
        return StopEvent()

    @step

## Run Multiple Branches & Put it all togehter

In these cases, it makes sense to run multiple branches. So, a single step can trigger multiple events at once! We can `send_event` via the context ðŸ‘‡

    Sending What are LlamaIndex workflows? to agent
    QueryAgent responded with:
     LlamaIndex workflows are an event-driven, step-based framework designed to control and manage the execution flow of complex applications, particularly those involving generative AI. They break an application into discrete Steps, each triggered by Events and capable of emitting further Events, allowing for complex logic involving loops, branches, and parallel execution.
    
    In a LlamaIndex workflow, steps perform functions ranging from simple tasks to complex agents, with inputs and outputs communicated via Events. This event-driven model facilitates maintainability and clarity, overcoming limitations of previous approaches like directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) which struggled with complex flows involving loops and branching.
    
    Key features include:
    - **Loops:** Steps can return events that loop back to previous steps to enable iterative processes.
    - **Branches:** Workflows can branch into different paths based on conditions, allowing for multiple distinct sequences of steps.
    - **Parallelism:** Multiple branches or steps can run concurrently and synchronize their results.
    - **State Maintenance:** Workflows support maintaining state and context throughout execution.
    - **Observability and Debugging:** Supported by various components and callbacks for monitoring.
    
    An example workflow might involve judging whether a query is of sufficient quality, looping to improve it if not, then concurrently executing different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategies, and finally judging their responses to produce a single output.
    
    Workflows are especially useful as applications grow in complexity, enabling developers to organize and control intricate AI logic more naturally and efficiently than traditional graph-based methods. For simpler pipelines, LlamaIndex suggests using workflows optionally, but for advanced agentic applications, workflows provide a flexible and powerful control abstraction.

    Sending How to use loops in llamaindex workflows to agent
    QueryAgent responded with:
     In LlamaIndex workflows, loops are implemented using an event-driven approach where you define custom event types and steps that emit events to control the workflow's execution flow. To create a loop, you define a custom event (e.g., `LoopEvent`) and a workflow step that can return either the event continuing the loop or another event to proceed. For example, a workflow step might randomly decide to either loop back (emit `LoopEvent` again) or continue to a next step emitting a different event.
    
    This allows creating flexible looping behaviors where any step can loop back to any other step by returning the corresponding event instances. The approach leverages Python's async functions decorated with `@step`, which process events and return the next event(s), enabling both loops and conditional branching in workflows.
    
    Thus, loops in LlamaIndex workflows are event-based, using custom event types and the return of events from steps to signal iterations until a condition is met.
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    from llamaindex.workflow import Workflow, Event, StartEvent, StopEvent, step
    import random
    
    class LoopEvent(Event):
        loop_output: str
    
    class FirstEvent(Event):
        first_output: str
    
    class MyWorkflow(Workflow):
        @step
        async def step_one(self, ev: StartEvent | LoopEvent) -> FirstEvent | LoopEvent:
            if random.randint(0, 1) == 0:
                print("Bad thing happened")
                return LoopEvent(loop_output="Back to step one.")
            else:
                print("Good thing happened")
                return FirstEvent(first_output="First step complete.")
    
        # ... other steps ...
    
    # Running this workflow will cause step_one to loop randomly until it proceeds.
    ```
    
    You can combine loops with branching and parallel execution in workflows to build complex control flows. For detailed guidance and examples, consult the LlamaIndex documentation under "Branches and Loops" and the "Workflows" guides.
