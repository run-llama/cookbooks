In this notebook, we try out the OpenAIAgent across a variety of query engine tools and datasets. We explore how OpenAIAgent can compare/replace existing workflows solved by our retrievers/query engines.

- Auto retrieval 
- Joint SQL and vector search

**NOTE:** Any Text-to-SQL application should be aware that executing 
arbitrary SQL queries can be a security risk. It is recommended to
take precautions as needed, such as using restricted roles, read-only
databases, sandboxing, etc.

## AutoRetrieval from a Vector Database

Our existing "auto-retrieval" capabilities (in `VectorIndexAutoRetriever`) allow an LLM to infer the right query parameters for a vector database - including both the query string and metadata filter.

Since the OpenAI Function API can infer function parameters, we explore its capabilities in performing auto-retrieval here.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

#### Define Function Tool

Here we define the function interface, which is passed to OpenAI to perform auto-retrieval.

We were not able to get OpenAI to work with nested pydantic objects or tuples as arguments,
so we converted the metadata filter keys and values into lists for the function API to work with.


```python
# define function tool
from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool
from llama_index.core.vector_stores import (
    VectorStoreInfo,
    MetadataInfo,
    MetadataFilter,
    MetadataFilters,
    FilterCondition,
    FilterOperator,
)
from llama_index.core.retrievers import VectorIndexRetriever
from llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine

from typing import List, Tuple, Any
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# define vector store info describing schema of vector store
vector_store_info = VectorStoreInfo(
    content_info="brief biography of celebrities",
    metadata_info=[
        MetadataInfo(
            name="category",
            type="str",
            description=(
                "Category of the celebrity, one of [Sports, Entertainment,"
                " Business, Music]"
            ),
        ),
        MetadataInfo(
            name="country",
            type="str",
            description=(
                "Country of the celebrity, one of [United States, Barbados,"
                " Portugal]"
            ),
        ),
        MetadataInfo(
            name="gender",
            type="str",
            description=("Gender of the celebrity, one of [male, female]"),
        ),
        MetadataInfo(
            name="born",
            type="int",
            description=("Born year of the celebrity, could be any integer"),
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Joint Text-to-SQL and Semantic Search

This is currently handled by our `SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine`.

Let's try implementing this by giving our `OpenAIAgent` access to two query tools: SQL and Vector 

**NOTE:** Any Text-to-SQL application should be aware that executing 
arbitrary SQL queries can be a security risk. It is recommended to
take precautions as needed, such as using restricted roles, read-only
databases, sandboxing, etc.

#### Load and Index Structured Data

We load sample structured datapoints into a SQL db and index it.


```python
from sqlalchemy import (
    create_engine,
    MetaData,
    Table,
    Column,
    String,
    Integer,
    select,
    column,
)
from llama_index.core import SQLDatabase
from llama_index.core.indices import SQLStructStoreIndex

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:", future=True)
metadata_obj = MetaData()
```


```python
# create city SQL table
table_name = "city_stats"
city_stats_table = Table(
    table_name,
    metadata_obj,
    Column("city_name", String(16), primary_key=True),
    Column("population", Integer),
    Column("country", String(16), nullable=False),
)

metadata_obj.create_all(engine)
```


```python
# print tables
metadata_obj.tables.keys()
```




    dict_keys(['city_stats'])




```python
from sqlalchemy import insert

rows = [
    {"city_name": "Toronto", "population": 2930000, "country": "Canada"},
    {"city_name": "Tokyo", "population": 13960000, "country": "Japan"},
    {"city_name": "Berlin", "population": 3645000, "country": "Germany"},
]
for row in rows:
    stmt = insert(city_stats_table).values(**row)
    with engine.begin() as connection:
        cursor = connection.execute(stmt)
```


```python
with engine.connect() as connection:
    cursor = connection.exec_driver_sql("SELECT * FROM city_stats")
    print(cursor.fetchall())
```

    [('Toronto', 2930000, 'Canada'), ('Tokyo', 13960000, 'Japan'), ('Berlin', 3645000, 'Germany')]



```python
sql_database = SQLDatabase(engine, include_tables=["city_stats"])
```


```python
from llama_index.core.query_engine import NLSQLTableQueryEngine

query_engine = NLSQLTableQueryEngine(
    sql_database=sql_database,
    tables=["city_stats"],
)
```

#### Load and Index Unstructured Data

We load unstructured data into a vector index backed by Pinecone


```python
# install wikipedia python package
%pip install wikipedia llama-index-readers-wikipedia
```


```python
from llama_index.readers.wikipedia import WikipediaReader

cities = ["Toronto", "Berlin", "Tokyo"]
wiki_docs = WikipediaReader().load_data(pages=cities)
```


```python
from pinecone import Pinecone, ServerlessSpec

pc = Pinecone(api_key=os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"])
```


```python
# dimensions are for text-embedding-3-small
pc.create_index(
    name="quickstart-sql",
    dimension=1536,
    metric="euclidean",
    spec=ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws", region="us-east-1"),
)

# may need to wait for index to be created
import time

time.sleep(10)
```


```python
# define pinecone index
index = pc.Index("quickstart-sql")
```


```python
# OPTIONAL: delete all
index.delete(deleteAll=True)
```


```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, StorageContext
from llama_index.vector_stores.pinecone import PineconeVectorStore
from llama_index.core.node_parser import TokenTextSplitter
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding

# define node parser and LLM
Settings.llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4o-mini")
Settings.embed_model = OpenAIEmbedding(model="text-embedding-3-small")
Settings.node_parser = TokenTextSplitter(chunk_size=1024)

# define pinecone vector index
vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(
    pinecone_index=index, namespace="wiki_cities"
)
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)
vector_index = VectorStoreIndex([], storage_context=storage_context)
```


```python
# Insert documents into vector index
# Each document has metadata of the city attached
for city, wiki_doc in zip(cities, wiki_docs):
    nodes = Settings.node_parser.get_nodes_from_documents([wiki_doc])
    # add metadata to each node
    for node in nodes:
        node.metadata = {"title": city}
    vector_index.insert_nodes(nodes)
```

#### Define Query Engines / Tools


```python
from llama_index.core.retrievers import VectorIndexAutoRetriever
from llama_index.core.vector_stores import MetadataInfo, VectorStoreInfo
from llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine
from llama_index.core.tools import QueryEngineTool


vector_store_info = VectorStoreInfo(
    content_info="articles about different cities",
    metadata_info=[
        MetadataInfo(
            name="title", type="str", description="The name of the city"
        ),
    ],
)

# pre-built auto-retriever, this works similarly to our custom auto-retriever above
vector_auto_retriever = VectorIndexAutoRetriever(
    vector_index, vector_store_info=vector_store_info
)

retriever_query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine.from_args(
    vector_auto_retriever,
)
```


```python
sql_tool = QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
    query_engine=query_engine,
    name="sql_tool",
    description=(
        "Useful for translating a natural language query into a SQL query over"
        " a table containing: city_stats, containing the population/country of"
        " each city"
    ),
)
vector_tool = QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
    query_engine=retriever_query_engine,
    name="vector_tool",
    description=(
        "Useful for answering semantic questions about different cities"
    ),
)
```

#### Initialize Agent


```python

# hold the context/session state for the agent
ctx = Context(agent)
```


```python

    "Tell me about the arts and culture of the city with the highest population. ",
    ctx=ctx,
)

async for ev in handler.stream_events():
    if isinstance(ev, ToolCallResult):
        print(
            f"\nCalled tool {ev.tool_name} with args {ev.tool_kwargs}, got response: {ev.tool_output}"
        )
    elif isinstance(ev, AgentStream):
        print(ev.delta, end="", flush=True)

response = await handler
```

    
    Called tool sql_tool with args {'input': 'SELECT city FROM city_stats ORDER BY population DESC LIMIT 1;'}, got response: The city with the highest population is Tokyo.
    
    Called tool vector_tool with args {'input': 'Tell me about the arts and culture of Tokyo.'}, got response: Tokyo boasts a vibrant arts and culture scene, characterized by a diverse range of museums, galleries, and performance venues.

    Called tool vector_tool with args {'input': 'Tell me about the history of Berlin.'}, got response: Berlin's history dates back to prehistoric times, with evidence of human settlements as early as 60,000 BC. The area saw the emergence of various cultures, including the Maglemosian culture around 9,000 BC and the Lusatian culture around 2,000 BC, as dense human settlements developed along the Spree and Havel rivers. By 500 BC, Germanic tribes began to settle in the region, followed by Slavic tribes in the 7th century.
    
    In the 12th century, the region came under German rule with the establishment of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The first written records of towns in the area appear in the late 12th century, with Berlin's founding date considered to be 1237. The towns of Berlin and Cölln formed close economic ties and eventually merged, with the Hohenzollern family ruling the area from the 14th century until 1918.
    
    The Thirty Years' War in the 17th century devastated Berlin, leading to significant population loss. However, under Frederick William, known as the "Great Elector," the city experienced a revival through policies promoting immigration and religious tolerance. The establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 marked a significant turning point, with Berlin becoming its capital.
    
    The 19th century brought the Industrial Revolution, transforming Berlin into a major economic center and leading to rapid population growth. By the late 19th century, Berlin was the capital of the newly founded German Empire. The city continued to grow and evolve through the 20th century, experiencing significant events such as World War II, the division into East and West Berlin during the Cold War, and reunification in 1990, when it once again became the capital of a unified Germany.
    
    Today, Berlin is recognized as a global city of culture, politics, media, and science, with a diverse economy and rich historical heritage.
