In this notebook, we will explore how to create a multi-agent system that uses a top-level agent to orchestrate a group of agents as tools. Specifically, we will create a system that can research, write, and review a report on a given topic.

This notebook will assume that you have already either read the [basic agent workflow notebook](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/agent_workflow_basic) or the [general agent documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/agent/).

## Setup

In this example, we will use `OpenAI` as our LLM. For all LLMs, check out the [examples documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/openai/) or [LlamaHub](https://llamahub.ai/?tab=llms) for a list of all supported LLMs and how to install/use them.

If we wanted, each agent could have a different LLM, but for this example, we will use the same LLM for all agents.


```python
%pip install llama-index
```


```python
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

sub_agent_llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini", api_key="sk-...")
orchestrator_llm = OpenAI(model="o3-mini", api_key="sk-...")
```

## System Design

Our system will have three agents:

1. A `ResearchAgent` that will search the web for information on the given topic.
2. A `WriteAgent` that will write the report using the information found by the `ResearchAgent`.
3. A `ReviewAgent` that will review the report and provide feedback.

We will then use a top-level agent to orchestrate the other agents to write our report.

While there are many ways to implement this system, in this case, we will use a single `web_search` tool to search the web for information on the given topic.



```python
%pip install tavily-python
```


```python
from tavily import AsyncTavilyClient


async def search_web(query: str) -> str:
    """Useful for using the web to answer questions."""
    client = AsyncTavilyClient(api_key="tvly-...")
    return str(await client.search(query))
```

With our tool defined, we can now create our sub-agents.

If the LLM you are using supports tool calling, you can use the `FunctionAgent` class. Otherwise, you can use the `ReActAgent` class.


```python
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import FunctionAgent, ReActAgent

research_agent = FunctionAgent(
    system_prompt=(
        "You are the ResearchAgent that can search the web for information on a given topic and record notes on the topic. "
        "You should output notes on the topic in a structured format."
    ),
    llm=sub_agent_llm,
    tools=[search_web],
)

write_agent = FunctionAgent(
    system_prompt=(
        "You are the WriteAgent that can write a report on a given topic. "
        "Your report should be in a markdown format. The content should be grounded in the research notes. "
        "Return your markdown report surrounded by <report>...</report> tags."
    ),
    llm=sub_agent_llm,
    tools=[],
)

review_agent = FunctionAgent(
    system_prompt=(
        "You are the ReviewAgent that can review the write report and provide feedback. "
        "Your review should either approve the current report or request changes to be implemented."
    ),
    llm=sub_agent_llm,
    tools=[],
)
```

With our sub-agents defined, we can then convert them into tools that can be used by the top-level agent.


```python
import re
from llama_index.core.workflow import Context


async def call_research_agent(ctx: Context, prompt: str) -> str:
    """Useful for recording research notes based on a specific prompt."""
    result = await research_agent.run(
        user_msg=f"Write some notes about the following: {prompt}"
    )

    state = await ctx.store.get("state")
    state["research_notes"].append(str(result))
    await ctx.store.set("state", state)

    return str(result)


async def call_write_agent(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Useful for writing a report based on the research notes or revising the report based on feedback."""
    state = await ctx.store.get("state")
    notes = state.get("research_notes", None)
    if not notes:
        return "No research notes to write from."

    user_msg = f"Write a markdown report from the following notes. Be sure to output the report in the following format: <report>...</report>:\n\n"

    # Add the feedback to the user message if it exists
    feedback = state.get("review", None)
    if feedback:
        user_msg += f"<feedback>{feedback}</feedback>\n\n"

    # Add the research notes to the user message
    notes = "\n\n".join(notes)
    user_msg += f"<research_notes>{notes}</research_notes>\n\n"

    # Run the write agent
    result = await write_agent.run(user_msg=user_msg)
    report = re.search(r"<report>(.*)</report>", str(result), re.DOTALL).group(
        1
    )
    state["report_content"] = str(report)
    await ctx.store.set("state", state)

    return str(report)


async def call_review_agent(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Useful for reviewing the report and providing feedback."""
    state = await ctx.store.get("state")
    report = state.get("report_content", None)
    if not report:
        return "No report content to review."

    result = await review_agent.run(
        user_msg=f"Review the following report: {report}"
    )
    state["review"] = result
    await ctx.store.set("state", state)

    return result
```

## Creating the Top-Level Orchestrator Agent

With our sub-agents defined as tools, we can now create our top-level orchestrator agent.


```python
orchestrator = FunctionAgent(
    system_prompt=(
        "You are an expert in the field of report writing. "
        "You are given a user request and a list of tools that can help with the request. "
        "You are to orchestrate the tools to research, write, and review a report on the given topic. "
        "Once the review is positive, you should notify the user that the report is ready to be accessed."
    ),
    llm=orchestrator_llm,
    tools=[
        call_research_agent,
        call_write_agent,
        call_review_agent,
    ],
    initial_state={
        "research_notes": [],
        "report_content": None,
        "review": None,
    },
)
```

## Running the Agent

Let's run our agents! We can iterate over events as the workflow runs.


```python
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import (
    AgentInput,
    AgentOutput,
    ToolCall,
    ToolCallResult,
    AgentStream,
)
from llama_index.core.workflow import Context

# Create a context for the orchestrator to hold history/state
ctx = Context(orchestrator)


async def run_orchestrator(ctx: Context, user_msg: str):
    handler = orchestrator.run(
        user_msg=user_msg,
        ctx=ctx,
    )

    async for event in handler.stream_events():
        if isinstance(event, AgentStream):
            if event.delta:
                print(event.delta, end="", flush=True)
        # elif isinstance(event, AgentInput):
        #     print("üì• Input:", event.input)
        elif isinstance(event, AgentOutput):
            # Skip printing the output since we are streaming above
            # if event.response.content:
            #     print("üì§ Output:", event.response.content)
            if event.tool_calls:
                print(
                    "üõ†Ô∏è  Planning to use tools:",
                    [call.tool_name for call in event.tool_calls],
                )
        elif isinstance(event, ToolCallResult):
            print(f"üîß Tool Result ({event.tool_name}):")
            print(f"  Arguments: {event.tool_kwargs}")
            print(f"  Output: {event.tool_output}")
        elif isinstance(event, ToolCall):
            print(f"üî® Calling Tool: {event.tool_name}")
            print(f"  With arguments: {event.tool_kwargs}")
```


```python
await run_orchestrator(
    ctx=ctx,
    user_msg=(
        "Write me a report on the history of the internet. "
        "Briefly describe the history of the internet, including the development of the internet, the development of the web, "
